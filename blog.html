    </p>
    <p>In today's digital world, servers are essential for the storage and protection of corporate data.

    <p>Servers are computing devices that provides functionality and information to other computers. It is composed of components similar to those found in a regular desktop computer, such as a motherboard, processor, and memory. However, the parts of a server are more robust and designed to handle more complex tasks. Each type of server is specifically designed for a particular purpose. 

        In essence, servers are designed to process requests for data from other computers and then provide the appropriate action. The information is sent back to the original requester or other computers via the internet/local area network. For a server to function correctly, it must be connected to a network so that users can access the data stored on it.</p>
    <p><u><strong>Why are servers important for business?

    </strong></u></p>
    <p>Servers provide businesses with a secure way to store data and enable employees to work more efficiently and productively by allowing authorised users to access the system remotely. The most critical role of a server is to protect an organisation's network while running applications in response to user requests.

    </p>
    <p><u><strong>The benefits:</strong></u></p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make remote work possible</li>
            <li>Deploy faster and more efficient applications  </li>
            <li>Less risk of data loss and workflow disruption.     </li>
            <li>Regular data backups increase reliability of resources     </li>

        </ul>
